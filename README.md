# Bluecherry Server Docker

Forked from [bluecherrydvr/bluecherry-docker](https://github.com/bluecherrydvr/bluecherry-docker) so that I can simplify the docker config.

To install, run `./scripts/install.sh` from this directory.

Notes:

- HTTP server is at https://localhost:7001
- Default credentials are `Admin` : `bluecherry`
- Ports 7001 & 7002 are exposed
- Website suggests adding cameras with transport type `TCP` rather than `UDP` or `Auto`
